# MachineLearningNationalBasketballAssociationGamePredictor

- Built a machine learning model to predict NBA game winners using box score data from seven seasons.
- Preprocessed and cleaned 17,000+ rows of game data by removing duplicate columns and sorting chronologically to ensure accurate feature selection.
- Implemented a target variable to predict future game outcomes based on historical game statistics, leveraging the Pandas library for efficient data manipulation.
- Trained the model to predict game outcomes using statistics from teams’ previous games, applying techniques to handle missing data (e.g., no future game available).
